# 🔗 SmitheryClient Integration & Usage Documentation

This document explains what has been implemented in the SmitheryClient module, how it integrates into a larger system, and how to use and test it effectively.

---

## 🧠 Project Context

**Goal**: To create a mock implementation of a `SmitheryClient` for tool discovery, workflow execution, and template management, as part of a larger bioinformatics semantic search platform.

---

## 🧩 Components Developed

### 1. `smithery_client/client.py`
- **Purpose**: Simulate interaction with Smithery’s tool search and tool metadata API.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `search_tools(query)`: Returns a list of tools based on a search string.
  - `get_tool_details(tool_id)`: Returns tool metadata (description, parameters, etc.)

### 2. `smithery_client/workflows.py`
- **Purpose**: Simulate executing a workflow using a selected tool.
- **Function**:
  - `execute_workflow(tool_id, params)`: Returns a mock result indicating the tool was "executed."

### 3. `smithery_client/templates.py`
- **Purpose**: Manage reusable workflow templates.
- **Functions**:
  - `create_template(name, tool_id, default_params)`
  - `get_template(name)`
  - `list_templates()`

---

## 🔐 API Structure & Security

- All simulated API calls mimic what a real HTTP client like `httpx` would do.
- Authorization headers are prepared but mocked.
- Ready for secure extension with real tokens or OAuth if needed.

---

## ✅ Testing Approach

### 1. Manual Testing
File: `run_test.py`
- Verifies tool search, tool detail lookup, workflow execution, and template logic.
- Output is printed to console for human inspection.

### 2. Automated Unit Tests
Files:
- `tests/test_client.py`
- `tests/test_workflows.py`
- `tests/test_templates.py`

Test coverage includes:
- Tool search and detail retrieval
- Workflow execution output validation
- Template lifecycle testing (create → get → list)

---

## 📘 Usage Instructions

### 🔧 Setup

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ▶️ Run the Manual Test Script

```bash
cd src
python run_test.py
```

Expected output:
- Tool search results
- Tool detail metadata
- Workflow execution success
- Template creation and retrieval logs

---

## 🔄 GitHub Integration

- Pushed to: `src/` folder of the main branch
- Includes: `smithery_client/`, `run_test.py`, `docs/usage.md`, `tests/`, `requirements.txt`
- Tracked via Git and ready for CI setup (e.g., GitHub Actions)

---

## 🏁 Future Improvements

- Connect to real Smithery API endpoints
- Implement real token-based auth
- Add retry logic, error logging, and API error parsing
- Set up CI workflows for automated test validation
