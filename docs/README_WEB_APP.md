## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Required for AI enhancement
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

# Optional: Custom port
PORT=8000
```

### 3. Run the Web Application

```bash
python main.py
```

### 4. Open Your Browser

Navigate to: http://localhost:8000

## üéØ How to Use

### Basic Search

1. **Enter a natural query** in the search box:
   - "I need tools for DNA sequence alignment"
   - "Looking for RNA-seq analysis software"
   - "What tools can I use for variant calling?"

2. **Click the search button** or press Enter

3. **View results** with:
   - AI-generated analysis
   - Recommended tools with relevance scores and quality grades
   - Source attribution
   - Direct links to tools (when available)
   - **Self-RAG quality metrics and reasoning**

### Example Queries

Try these realistic bioinformatics queries:

#### Sequence Analysis
- "I need tools for DNA sequence alignment"
- "Looking for multiple sequence alignment software"
- "What tools can I use for sequence motif discovery?"

#### Genomics & NGS
- "I'm working on RNA-seq data and need analysis tools"
- "Looking for variant calling software for my NGS data"
- "What are the best tools for genome assembly?"

#### Protein Analysis
- "I need protein structure prediction tools"
- "What software can I use for protein-protein interactions?"
- "Looking for tools to identify protein domains"

#### Phylogenetics
- "I need to build phylogenetic trees from my sequence data"
- "Looking for molecular evolution analysis tools"

#### Data Analysis
- "I need to visualize my genomic data"
- "Looking for statistical analysis tools for my RNA-seq results"

## üß† Self-RAG Quality Control

This web app now uses a **Self-RAGAgent** for all queries, providing:

- **Automatic Query Refinement**: If the initial query is too broad or unclear, the agent will refine it for better results.
- **Tool Relevance Grading**: Each tool is graded for relevance to your query, with reasoning shown in the UI.
- **Hallucination Detection**: The agent checks if recommendations are grounded in real, factual sources.
- **Iterative Improvement**: The agent can run multiple rounds of search and refinement to maximize answer quality.
- **Quality Metrics**: See at-a-glance indicators for relevance, factual accuracy, and answer quality.

**How it works:**
- When you submit a query, the agent may refine it, grade the results, and iterate up to 3 times for the best answer.
- The UI displays quality grades (e.g., "Verified", "Low Relevance") and reasoning for each tool.
- The analysis section summarizes the quality assessment for the whole answer.
